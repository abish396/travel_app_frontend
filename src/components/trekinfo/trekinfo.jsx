            Parang La trek takes you through the verdant beauty of Spiti Valley.
            Here is a nine-day long adventure expedition to Parang La from Kaza,
            the beautiful starting point which is really suitable for a perfect
            commencement of such an expedition. In the first lap of the trek,
            Kibber at an altitude of 14000 feet and centuries old Ki monastery
            will be the ideal place to explore and after crossing many narrow
            river gorges you will reach Dumla. The quite tough and demanding
            phase of the trek comes when you move from Thaltak Meadow to Jagtha
            and from there to Bomgrojen.
